# Avrora-Logic-Game <img src="https://github.com/Pe3aTeJlb/Pe3aTeJlb/blob/main/ReadmeResources/ALG/logo.png" width="50" height="50" />

This project was rewritten from [ALG](https://github.com/Pe3aTeJlb/Avrora-logic-game) during november 2020 for an automated training system "Amadey" splitted off from ATS "Avrora".
It is a rethinking of [K. Polyakov](https://www.kpolyakov.spb.ru/) "Logic" game and based on [Circuit simulator](https://lushprojects.com/circuitjs/) by [Paul Falstad](https://github.com/pfalstad/circuitjs1) and [Iain Sharp](https://github.com/sharpie7/circuitjs1).
This App implements logic game based on logic gates system.
