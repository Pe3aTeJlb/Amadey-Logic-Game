#Rules
RulesTitle=Amadey Logic Game: Rules
RulesBody= You are offered 10 logic circuits to solve.\nEach circuit consists of several subcircuits in one of the logical bases.\nTo complete a level, you need to deliver a block of data from the upper platform to the lower one.\nPlatforms are controlled by the corresponding output signal of the subcircuit, which is formed by means of input signals.\nA data block can only move to one platform at a time.\nOtherwise, it is "damaged" and you are fined 20 points.\nThe level starts over.\nIf you have completed 10 levels and have not lost all points, you will receive a corresponding notification.
